<p>Hey TechFest! ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>First of all, thank you so much for attending my talk! I hope I was able to get you excited about what GraphQL can do for you, and motivate you to consider using it for your next/current project!</p>
<p>Check out the links to my slides and to the sample GraphQL app I demoed during the presentation above. No guarantees that the sample app will continue to work in the future, but I plan to keep it up for at least the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Also, if you're curious about how it's possible for GraphQL to be "versionless", <a href="https://graphqlme.com/2019/04/18/how-is-graphql-versionless/">check out my blog post detailing that</a>.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed it, and if you have any questions, <a href="https://graphqlme.com/about/">I'd love to chat</a>.<br />

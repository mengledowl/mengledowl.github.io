I don't remember exactly how I found it.<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
Perhaps I was reading some blog posts about GraphQL and there was a link. Or maybe I saw a reference to it in the GraphQL slack. Heck, I could have been searching for a specific blog post by him that I was trying to reference and it was one of the results. I really can't remember.<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
What I do remember is the excitement - Marc-André Giroux, currently at GitHub and previously at Shopify, was heads-down writing a book about GraphQL!<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
I immediately signed up to get updates and anxiously awaited the release of his book.<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2>Why Do I Care?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
In the years since I started using and promoting GraphQL, the number of good resources on it has been, well... pretty sparse. It's part of the reason why I started this blog to begin with; I wanted to contribute a little something to the space so that people (especially newcomers) could learn something about GraphQL beyond the basics.<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
Some of the primary things that people tend to struggle with are the same things that tend not to have much information available to find (online or elsewhere):<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Schema design best-practices</li>
<li>Performance (outside of the general "avoid N+1s with dataloader")</li>
<li>Security pitfalls &amp; best-practices</li>
<li>General best-practices and considerations</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Lifecycle management (eg. code-to-deployment)</li>
<li>Almost everything else</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
Schema design in particular is incredibly nuanced, and in many cases we haven't had a lot of time to see great patterns emerge and anti-patterns be identified as such (though there are certainly several).<br />

<h2>Marc-André</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
I've "known" Marc-André for a couple of years now. Our direct interactions have been relatively few, but the number of people who are involved in the GraphQL community ("I use GraphQL" does <strong>not</strong> count as "involved" in this case) is not huge, so we tend to know each other. Over the last couple of years, he has consistently shown that he has a nuanced, thoughtful, and experienced approach to all things GraphQL.<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
For those that don't know him, Marc-André currently works at GitHub, and before that he was at Shopify. At both of these companies, much of his work has involved their respective public GraphQL APIs. This puts him in a unique position of having worked on what are arguably the largest (in probably all conceivable ways) two public GraphQL APIs in the world. This is especially impressive when you consider how few of them there are to begin with - I can only think of about 3 public GraphQL APIs off the top of my head.<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
I'm sure there are plenty of people who have worked on two or more GraphQL APIs by this point - myself included - but the distinction of "public" is an important one here: public APIs, and especially public <em>GraphQL</em> APIs typically evolve in a very different way that private/internal ones. There are so many more implications to any changes, design decisions, mistakes, etc. where a public API is concerned.<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
So, in short: Marc-André has a lot of thought-provoking ideas and general advice when it comes to GraphQL that have been fed by his experience working on two very large public GraphQL APIs now at separate companies.<br />

<h2>In Review</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
Now that I've blathered on for an eternity, let's get to the book itself!<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
First of all, what do you get with a purchase of the book?<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
The entire book is 186 pages in PDF form, including the title page, so not super long, but it is certainly packed full of great information. You can get it in both PDF and ePub formats. To quote the subtitle, the book is about:<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Building well designed, performant, and secure GraphQL APIs at scale.</p></blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The topics span the gamut of all things GraphQL. To give you an idea, here are the titles of the chapters, from the table of contents:<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>An Introduction to GraphQL</li>
<li>GraphQL Schema Design</li>
<li>Implementing GraphQL Servers</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Performance &amp; Monitoring</li>
<li>Tooling</li>
<li>Workflow</li>
<li>Public GraphQL APIs</li>
<li>GraphQL in a Distributed Architecture</li>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li>Documenting GraphQL APIs</li>
<li>Migrating From Other API Styles</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
That's a lot of stuff!<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
In addition, for a bit of extra money, you can get the book, <strong>plus</strong>:<br />
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Three extra guides (Schema Design Cheat Sheet, Schema Evolution Guide, and Schema Reviews Analysis)</li>
<li>Interviews with engineers from Shopify, GitHub, AirBnB, and Paypal</li>
<li>An invitation to the private Slack channel for the book</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
As for the book itself, I was very impressed. It was fascinating to see just how many of the same conclusions we'd come to separately after years of working on GraphQL APIs, especially in the realm of schema design.<br />

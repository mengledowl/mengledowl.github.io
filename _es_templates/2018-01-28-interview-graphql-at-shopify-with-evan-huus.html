<p>Hey {{NAME}}!</p>
<p>Last month I <a href="https://graphqlme.com/2017/12/21/interview-with-robert-mosolgo-creator-of-graphql-ruby/">released my first interview with Robert Mosolgo</a>, who created the graphql-ruby gem.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed getting to do that, so I've got another one for you this month! This time, I got to sit down with Evan Huus from Shopify and interview him about GraphQL at Shopify. We got to talk about all kinds of things, from the success of GraphQL at Shopify to their ~6,000 word API design tutorial that guides their best practices for GraphQL/API design, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Just like last time, I transcribed the whole thing and you can view the video and the transcription here:</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy watching this interview as much as I enjoyed conducting it!</p>
<p>Thanks for all of your support, {{NAME}}, and let me know what you think of this latest interview :D</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<p>Hey {{NAME}}!</p>
<p>Last week, I sent out an email letting you know to be on the lookout for a special surprise that I had coming soon.</p>
<p>Well -Â <strong>it's here.</strong></p>
<p>I was originally going to wait until Saturday to release this, but <strong>I just couldn't stand it</strong>. I have been so excited to release this that I couldn't wait that long.</p>
<p>So here it is!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, <strong>I got a chance to sit down and interview Robert Mosolgo</strong>, who created the graphql-ruby gem. He agreed to let me pick his brain for well over an hour with all kinds of really interesting questions about the gem, his job at GitHub where he works on their GraphQL API, and all sorts of things about GraphQL.</p>
<p><strong>I <a href="https://graphqlme.com/2017/12/21/interview-with-robert-mosolgo-creator-of-graphql-ruby/">recorded the whole thing on video</a>, and today I'm releasing it!</strong></p>
<p>Oh, and if videos aren't your thing or you aren't in a place where you can watch/listen, I also had the entire interview transcribed so you can read it if you prefer.</p>
<p>This has been one of the most enjoyable things I've ever had the pleasure of doing, and I really hope that you get as much out of it as I did! Check it out and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes peeled - I may or may not have more where that came from ;)</p>
<p>-Matt</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey {{NAME}}!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I normally stick to just sending out emails to notify my readers about new blog posts, which happens about once a week, but this time I’m breaking from that pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I wanted to let you know that </span><b>I’ve got something pretty cool/different</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than what I normally do coming out soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a blog post. Well, it will be accompanied by a blog post, but that’s not the main thrust of it.</span></p>
<p>I can't really tell you what it is just yet (because then it wouldn't be a surprise anymore!), but I'm extremely excited about it and wanted to give you a heads-up so you would know to be on the look-out.</p>
<p><b>I’m also going to be counting on your input, {{NAME}}.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to know what you think of it when it comes out, so that I can keep refining the content that I produce and make sure that it is something that is providing value to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for taking the time to read this, and remain vigilant! It will be coming soon, and I think you will really enjoy it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Matt</span></p>

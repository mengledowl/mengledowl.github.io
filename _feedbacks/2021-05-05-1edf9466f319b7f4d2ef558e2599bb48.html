    Good Day, <br />\r\nMy name is Michael Omran, a financial consultant to late Mr.
    Greg Mao who died of liver and kidney failure in 2009, was an oil consultant with
    Shell and Mobile corporations, who made a substantial deposit with HSBC bank.
    His wife Mrs. Renate Greg died of Covid-19 complications in Germany. Efforts to
    reach their family members proved abortive, and unfortunately my late client did
    not state his Will in his deposit nor does he have any child. This fund has been
    floating in the bank with the principal interest rolling over and no one to claim
    it. <br />\r\nRight now I am looking for a partner that will stand as Next of
    Kin to my late client cause I have a reliable lawyer that will prepare an MoU
    for us to sign, a letter of notarisation and transfer of ownership documents that
    will facilitate the transfer of the fund to you as the next of kin. <br />\r\nMy
    major concern right now is that at the expiration of 15 years, if no one comes
    forward to claim the fund, the fund will be tagged as an unclaimed fund and the
    bank will take full possession of the fund. <br />\r\nPlease send reply to: drmichaelomran@gmail.com
    if you are interested for further details. <br />\r\nThank you <br />\r\nMr. Michael

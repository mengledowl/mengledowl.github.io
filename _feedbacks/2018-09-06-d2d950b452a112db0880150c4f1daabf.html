    /><br /><b>Email:</b> xiechao06@gmail.com<br /><br /><b>Message:</b> Hi, thanks
    for all your blogs, they do teach me a lot, in my current project, I adopt your
    way of handling errors, and it works for me most of the time.  https://graphqlme.com/2018/03/17/i-thought-of-a-better-way-to-handle-errors/.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\n But I think it does not cope with validation error (for example,
    json web token expired) so well,  becuase:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. expiration should
    be handled out of business logic in client, namely, if you go expired, login again,
    don't handle the business anymore<br />\r\n2.  it is stupid to issue query like:
    <br />\r\n<br />\r\n{<br />\r\n    getA(...) {...}<br />\r\n    getB(...) {...}<br
    />\r\n}<br />\r\n<br />\r\nand get results like: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n{<br />\r\n
    \  data: {<br />\r\n        getA {<br />\r\n             error: { code: 'TOKEN_EXPIRED'
    }<br />\r\n        },<br />\r\n       getB  {<br />\r\n             error: { code:
    'TOKEN_EXPIRED' }<br />\r\n        }<br />\r\n   }<br />\r\n} <br />\r\n<br />\r\nso
    I suggest that this particular kind of error should be put at the top  level,
    like:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n {<br />\r\n     error: {<br />\r\n           errors:
    {<br />\r\n                [code: 'TOKEN_EXPIRED']<br />\r\n           }<br />\r\n
    \    }<br />\r\n}<br />\r\n<br />\r\nbut this way, it will mess with the type
    system error, as in your blog \"https://graphqlme.com/2017/12/31/stop-fighting-the-type-system/\".
    I wish you could give me a better way to handle this kind of error, thanks very
    much!<br /><br /><br /><hr />Time: September 6, 2018 at 2:40 pm<br />IP Address:

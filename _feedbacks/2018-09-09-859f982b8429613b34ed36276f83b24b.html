    I read your post https://graphqlme.com/2018/05/13/transactions-mutations-and-graphql/<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I found it a bit too general and a little startling. I am
    really bothered about the fact that GraphQl has no transactions and I find it
    hard to believe I have to rethink all DB modelling tasks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake
    for example a DB type that involves several arrays with complex children. No matter
    what's your schema you always end up with some type like these.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow,
    it is easy to expect a use case that requires you to make copies of such an object.
    Now, go ahead and do it without transactions or, I'll be happy to see a schema
    design option that eliminates such a problem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegards,<br />\r\nArie

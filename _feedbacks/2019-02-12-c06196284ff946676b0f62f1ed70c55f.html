    Hello,<br />\r\nI have developed an application for bloggers and readers for iPhone
    and iPad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe key points are:<br />\r\n- Easily find blogs
    with to a dedicated search engine (While the web search engines display only the
    same already popular blogs)<br />\r\n- Discover blogs by topics, by trends<br
    />\r\n- The reader can follow a blog in one top (don't need to create a bookmark
    in the web browser)<br />\r\n- A news feed to get all new posts in one page<br
    />\r\n- Because the reader has all its blogs in one place, he has more time to
    read posts and discover blogs.<br />\r\n- Importing an existing WordPress only
    takes a few minutes. And keeping it updated with the new posts from your WordPress
    site needs only one tap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe application
    has been launched on the Apple app store and I’m looking for bloggers that would
    import their WordPress blog in the app.  Or, at least, bloggers who would give
    me the permission to import their blog in the app.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can

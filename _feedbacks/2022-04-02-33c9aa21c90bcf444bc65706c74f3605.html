    I, Ross Ward, have announced my candidacy for South Carolina House District 112
    as the Republican nominee and I need your help. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nAs I complete
    my 3rd and final year at the prestigious Charleston School of Law, I am awestruck
    by the poetic language of Our Constitution and the great legal system which emerged
    from humble origins. Then, I look at the state of our nation and ponder where
    it all went wrong: <br />\r\nSkyrocketing gas prices <br />\r\nCitizens robbed
    of their civil liberties <br />\r\nA fraudulently elected President <br />\r\nNever
    has the demand for leadership been greater than at this moment. <br />\r\nI need
    your help to make a difference: https://bit.ly/ross-ward-for-sc <br />\r\n <br
    />\r\nI am committed to: <br />\r\nChristian Values <br />\r\nPutting America
    First <br />\r\nA Robust Military <br />\r\n <br />\r\nMy website is: https://www.rosswardrepublican.com
    <br />\r\n <br />\r\nI am ready to move South Carolina forward by fighting for
    the values of Donald Trump and the America First movement and against the radical
    leftist destruction of traditional family values. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nIf you
    can help, please donate: https://bit.ly/ross-ward-for-sc<br /><br /><br /><hr

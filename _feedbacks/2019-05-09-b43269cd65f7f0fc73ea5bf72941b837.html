<p>I'm new to GraphQL and your articles have been very helpful. Your N+1 article is good but it's a bit old (two whole years!). I noticed that v1.9 of the ruby gem has a new way to address the problem with Lookahead[1]. Sounds neat but I can't find any in depth articles, and the examples in the docs don't actually show how to solve N+1 db lookups with ActiveRecord. I wonder if you still recommend using graphql-batch, or Lookahead, or some other gem like batch-loader[2]. Perhaps inspiration for a new article? :)</p>
<p>One more thing, I was very confused reading the first few articles because your code examples use the "old" define style instead of the new class style. It took me a while to stumble upon the history explanation in the ruby-graphql docs [3] before the mismatch made sense. Maybe you could add a one-line note to your older articles about it to help future newbies?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

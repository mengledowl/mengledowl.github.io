    Good afternoon, you're reading this letter as we want everyone in our crypto world
    and not only to be aware of cooperating with a serial entrepreneur and professiona
    SCAMMER called Serge Gianchandani. He lives in Dehli, India. <br />\r\nHe is CEO
    (or CPO - his position is also differs in many sources) and co-founder of Metamall
    and so called 'serial entrepreneur'. All his projects are poor and look like scam
    as soon as it reach listing. <br />\r\nHe stole more than $50,000 from investors
    by taking the money for the SAFT and not sending the tokens. 50k$ is only a small
    part of who we found, I think the amounts are estimated at millions of dollars.
    We have all the proofs of what we’re saying. We can send it to anyone, just send
    request to: SCAM.SergeMetamall@gmail.com <br />\r\nBecause we haven't received
    Metamall tokens we asked for refund and return of money of our investors. But
    Serge refused to return 50000 USDT. So we haven't received neither the tokens,
    nor the invested money. We where SCAMMED! <br />\r\n <br />\r\nHis contacts can
    be found below, we would be grateful if you would complain about him in social
    networks. Very soon we will turn down his website of Metamalls. <br />\r\n <br
